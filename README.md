# Natural Language Processing libraries
This is a very basic natural language processing (NLP) word counter that uses the SpaCy Python library for preprocessing in Spanish and Pandas for value manipulation.
Spanish language processing is not nearly as developed as English langauge processing, and certain Python NLP modules function better than others. This is a subject I am researching.
