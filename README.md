# Word-Counter
This is a very basic natural language processing (NLP) word counter that uses the SpaCy Python library for preprocessing and Pandas for value manipulation in Spanish.
Spanish language processing is not nearly as developed as Englosh langauge processing, and certain Python NLP modules function better than others. This is a subject I am researching.
